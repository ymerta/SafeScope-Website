🚧 SafeScope: AI-Powered Site Safety Monitoring System
SafeScope is an AI-based safety system developed to monitor personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance and dangerous proximity between workers and heavy machinery in real-time on construction and industrial sites. It combines deep learning models with a responsive web application to prevent accidents and improve workplace safety.

🔍 Project Highlights:

PPE Detection: Identifies helmet, vest, and glove usage via YOLO-based computer vision models.

Proximity Calculation: Continuously monitors the distance between workers and machines to detect unsafe conditions.

Real-Time Alerts: Sends immediate alerts to the dashboard via WebSocket.

Web Application: Built with React.js and Firebase; includes dashboards, alert logs, and worker-machine analytics.

Modular Architecture: The model backend and frontend app are decoupled for flexible deployment.
